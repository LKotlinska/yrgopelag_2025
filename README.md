# Terracotta Bay Hotel - Yrgopelag

This repository contains a web project developed as part of a school assignment.  
The project implements a simple booking-style application with a clear file structure and basic backend functionality.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to apply fundamental web development concepts in a structured and readable way.  
Focus has been placed on separating logic from presentation and organizing files in a way that supports further development.

---

## Content & Structure

The application is built with a straightforward content structure:

- Headings are used to create a clear hierarchy
- Text content is short and neutral in tone
- Navigation and layout follow consistent patterns

The written content is intentionally kept simple to prioritize clarity and usability.

---

## Project Organization

The project is divided into distinct parts with separate responsibilities:

- **Views**  
  Files responsible for rendering pages and layouts.

- **Components**  
  Reusable interface elements shared across multiple pages.

- **Controllers**  
  Server-side scripts that handle form submissions and application logic.

- **Functions**  
  Helper functions used for validation, calculations, and repeated logic.

This organization reduces duplication and improves readability.

---

## Reuse of Code

To avoid repeated code:

- Shared elements are implemented as components
- Common logic is extracted into functions
- Messages for errors and success states use a shared structure

This makes the application easier to maintain and modify.

---

## User Feedback & Validation

User input is validated before processing.  
Feedback is provided when validation fails or when an action is completed successfully.  
Messages are written to be understandable without technical knowledge.

---

## Technologies

- HTML
- PHP
- JavaScript
- SQLite / MySQL

No external frameworks are used.

---

## What the Project Covers

- Basic application flow from input to response
- Server-side handling of form data
- Database interaction
- Reusable components
- Simple client-side interaction

---

## Further Development

Possible areas for further work include:

- Additional validation rules
- Improved accessibility
- Expanded booking management
- Code refactoring for scalability

---

## Future Improvements

Given additional development time, the following improvements would be implemented:

- **CSS structure**  
  Introduce CSS variables for repeated values, reduce overly broad selectors, and split styles into multiple files to improve maintainability.

- **Discount handling**  
  Information about whether a guest is a returning customer could be stored as part of the booking or guest data. This would allow the receipt page to fetch and display applied discounts.
